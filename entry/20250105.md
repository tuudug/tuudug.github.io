there are some periods when i start to seriously doubt my ability to code. i just start wondering how the hell did i even arrive at this point? did i get lucky? what the hell even happened? impostor syndrome is an annoying thing ngl.

anyway i have a friend that studies computer science abroad. and he asks me to teach some stuff sometimes. and it usually goes well and i'm able to teach him the stuff. but i'm just left wondering, **how the hell am i a better teach than literal professors?** does my friend just not learn things the first time around? maybe the teachers are just genuinely ass? we may never know. and this is not really me stroking my own ego either lmfao. just a funny little obversation.
