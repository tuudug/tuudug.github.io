I don't really get what's the deal with everyone. CAN YOU GUYS STOP SAYING 'idk' OR 'not really' WHEN I ASK FOR SOMETHING??? Literally just do something I say for once LITERALLY ONCE it's crazy man ? Either way I moved office furniture today and walked like 20k steps and my foot is gonna fucking DIE on god 

also people really stop gotta saying 'i love you' or whatever the fuck **if they don't mean it.** it's getting really annoying rofl;;
