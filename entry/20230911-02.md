this entry is about a certain someone. there isn't really much to say about them, i'm just slightly baffled by their behaivor. how can one person just leapfrog from dating someone every few months? like they would allegedly love them so much they would write a whole blog post about them, only to dump or break up with them in like 1 month or some shit? dump someone for another person and get back together with the person they have dumped with? it is quite fucked up tbh.
